# Accessible Form UI

Create an accessible form UI using HTML and CSS.

## Description

In this project, you are required to create a form UI using only HTML and CSS. The form will include fields for a full name, email, password, and confirm password, along with a button to toggle the visibility of the password text. Additionally, the form will feature a completeness progress bar and a checklist of requirements that must be met for the form to reach 100% completeness. While this version of the form wonâ€™t be functional, it will be a static UI component that can be enhanced with JavaScript in the future.

The goal of this project is to not only help you practice your HTML and CSS but also to focus on creating an accessible form that is easy to use for all users, including those with disabilities.
